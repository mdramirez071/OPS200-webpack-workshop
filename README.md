This project is called "Webpack Workshop" which is part of the OPS200 module. Simply clone the files from GitHub, open up the Terminal, run 'npm install' then run 'npm run build' or 'webpack -p' if you need a production build (Optional). Then run 'npm start' to start up the live server then navigate to http://localhost:3000 inside of your web browser. To verify that the webpack webpage will render properly with react, run "npm test" in the Terminal.
